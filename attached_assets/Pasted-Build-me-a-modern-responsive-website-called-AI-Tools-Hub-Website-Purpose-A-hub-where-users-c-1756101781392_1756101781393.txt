Build me a modern responsive website called “AI Tools Hub”.

🔹 Website Purpose:
A hub where users can discover, compare, and learn about AI tools. It should feel like a futuristic dashboard (not a boring blog).

🔹 Pages/Sections Needed:

Home Page

Big search bar asking: “What do you want to do with AI?”

Trending tools carousel/grid

Category buttons (Text, Image, Video, Coding, Music, Productivity, Business, etc.)

Task finder shortcuts (like “Create a logo”, “Write an essay”, etc.)

Newsletter signup box.

Discover Tools Page

Grid of tools (Card design with logo, short description, pricing tag, button).

Filters (Free/Paid, Popular, Category).

Tool Details Page

Tool logo + screenshots.

Full description.

Pricing info.

Pros/Cons.

“Visit Website” button.

Suggested similar tools.

Compare Page

User selects 2 tools → Show side-by-side comparison (features, pricing, ratings).

Community Page

Form to submit new AI tools.

Upvote system.

Leaderboard of contributors.

Blog/News Page

Latest AI news and tutorial articles.

My Toolkit (Account Section)

Users can log in/sign up.

Save their favorite tools into a personal toolkit.

🔹 Design Style:

Default dark mode, but include a theme toggle button (🌙/☀️) to switch between dark/light.

Modern UI → TailwindCSS, rounded cards, hover effects, smooth transitions.

Colors → Dark gray background, Neon Blue + Purple highlights.

Font → Clean and futuristic (like Inter or Poppins).

🔹 Special Features:

Dark/Light mode toggle with smooth animation + localStorage (remembers preference).

AI Tool Recommender → If user types a task (e.g., “make a comic”), recommend best tools.

Newsletter form (just front-end, no backend needed).

Animations with Framer Motion for smooth UI.

🔹 Tech Stack:

Frontend: HTML + TailwindCSS + JavaScript (React or Next.js preferred, but vanilla JS is okay).

Backend (optional for now): Node.js or Python Flask (for database, login, saving tools). For now, just use static JSON data for tools.

Database (optional for now): JSON file (mock data of tools).

🔹 Extra Requirements:

Make the site fully responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop).

Add a sticky navbar with: Home | Discover | Compare | Community | Blog | Toolkit | Dark/Light Toggle.

Smooth page transitions (fade/slide).
